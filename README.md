Kodi timer script to exit kodi based on viewing times held in a file on a remote server.  Defaults to allowing viewing between 0700 and 2100 if no file found or an error occurs.

Script was written for kodi running on a raspberry pi under libreelec.

An example pi-times.xml file is included to show how to set it up.
